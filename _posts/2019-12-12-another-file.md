You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```java
class HelloWorld() {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    int x = 5;
    System.out.println("Hello World this is long text to test the top right button ok tested maybe it should work i see idk fjskdjf sjdfkjs;klsj dfas fjdskl fjsal df");
  }
}
```

```python
x = 5
print(x)
def Hi():
  return "Hello"
```
